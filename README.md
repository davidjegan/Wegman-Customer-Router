### Goal
We leverage the Wegman API (transient API allowance) to find shortest location from a customers location to the Wegman store. Also upon uploading an image, the user will be given all details about the dish like ingredients,  

```python
print('Name of the Dish: '+ str(newid['name']))
print('Wellness Ingredients: '+str(newid['wellnessKeys']))
print('Total ingredients required is '+str(len(ingredients)))


```
